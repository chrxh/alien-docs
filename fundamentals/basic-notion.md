# Basic Notion

Generally, all bodies as well as radiations are modeled via different types of particles within an ALIEN simulation. The following terms are frequently used in this documentation.

### World

An ALIEN world is two-dimensional rectangular domain with periodic boundary conditions. The space is modeled as a continuum.

### Cells

Cells are particles which serve as matter building blocks and which are able to connect to each others. On can think of them as the nodes of a graph embedded in a 2D space. Moreover, they have an internal state and physical properties.
