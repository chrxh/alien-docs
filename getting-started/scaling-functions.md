# Scaling functions

#### Abstract

We will continue in this tutorial by exploring ways to scale simulation data. One powerful method that we have already encountered is the mass creation of patterns from a template. This time, we will be dealing with a pre-built machine and using it to create a large formation with a grid layout. In doing so, we can influence the velocities and the angle of the individual specimens. And to make the whole thing a bit fun, we construct a world in which countless interceptor machines chase after a large object. In the end, we'll add one more on top and duplicate the entire world.
