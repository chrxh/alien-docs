# Construct worlds

#### Abstract

The aim here is to learn how to create own worlds filled with different colored bodies consisting of simple geometric shapes or freehand drawings. We will also make use of predefined patterns. In the process, we will familiarize ourselves with a multiplication function that allows us to mass-multiply arbitrary patterns with adjustable randomness.

## Start with an empty world

The first step for our own world is to create a new empty world via the _Simulation_ menu and then _New_. In the dialog we can set the dimensions and adopt the simulation parameters and symbol tables from the previous simulation. A dimension of 1000 by 1000 units and an adoption of the settings is sufficient for our purposes for now.

Please note that the length units do not represent pixels in the strict sense. The world is treated as a continuum. A length unit is rendered as one pixel at a zoom level of 1.0.
