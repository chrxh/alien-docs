# Construct worlds

#### Abstract

The aim here is to learn how to create own worlds filled with different colored bodies consisting of simple geometric shapes or freehand drawings. We will also make use of predefined patterns. In the process, we will familiarize ourselves with a multiplication function that allows us to mass-multiply arbitrary patterns with adjustable randomness.
