# Particle editing

#### Abstract

It is possible to select any entity, manipulate their properties and memory, and get real-time updates during a running simulation. For this purpose, editing windows can be pinned to particles. We will make use of this feature by inspecting a self-replicating particle machine in more detail and perform specific changes.

## Pin editing windows to cells and energy particles





## Autotracking and live updates&#x20;



## Change cell properties
