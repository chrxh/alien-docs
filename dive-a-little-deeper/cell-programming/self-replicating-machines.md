# Self-replicating machines

#### Abstract

There are several ways to create self-replicating structures. In this article, machines with the ability to self-replicate by inspection will be described. On the one hand they need a mechanism to read out their own structure and internal states and, on the other hand, they need apparatus to replicate them.

## Cell skeleton

We build our self-replicating machine as a simple loop. A more complicated topology is of course also conceivable, but not relevant for our rather minimal example. In general, replication costs energy and since energy conservation must be satisfied in ALIEN, in addition to the ability to self-replicate, we also need simple movement and digestion functionality so that sufficient energy can be provided.
