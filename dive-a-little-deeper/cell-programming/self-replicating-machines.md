# Self-replicating machines

#### Abstract

There are several ways to create self-replicating structures. In this article, machines with the ability to self-replicate by inspection will be described. On the one hand they need a mechanism to read out their own structure and internal states and, on the other hand, they need apparatus to replicate them.
