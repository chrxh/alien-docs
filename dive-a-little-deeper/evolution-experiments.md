# Evolution experiments

#### Abstract

We will perform evolutionary simulations by injecting self-replicating machines into pristine worlds. Mutations will lead to gradual optimizations of the individuals. In this context, we want discuss the influence of crucial simulation parameters on cell functions. ALIEN offers advanced features like inhomogeneous parameter values, which we will also make use of. We will then address how we  larger self-replicating machines can be utilized.

## Simulation setup for small self-replicators

The basic idea is simple: we create an empty world, fill it with enough particles, inject a self-replicating machine and activate occasional mutations. The rest is done by the ongoing simulation.
