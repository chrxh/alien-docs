# Evolution experiments

#### Abstract

We will perform evolutionary simulations by injecting self-replicating machines into pristine worlds. Mutations lead to gradual optimizations of the individuals. In this context, we discuss the influence of crucial simulation parameters on cell functions. ALIEN offers advanced features like inhomogeneous parameter values, which we will also make use of. We will then address how we  larger self-replicating machines can be utilized.
