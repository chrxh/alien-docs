# Simulation parameters

#### Abstract

By adjusting simulation parameters we can customize the physical laws as well as cell functions and mutations. ALIEN offers the possibility to vary such parameters spatially as well as temporarily. This allows us to create diversified worlds, which are especially interesting for evolutionary simulations because different parameters require different evolutionary adaptations. Here we want to explore some possibilities for setting simulation parameters and their effects.
