# First Steps with the Editor

### Abstract

In this section we will familiarize ourselves with some basic functions of the editor. The user has the possibility to directly intervene both in running and paused simulation. In the latter case, extensive editing features are available, a few of which will be mentioned here.

### 1. Apply forces to objects in a running simulation

For testing purposes we load the simulation `./examples/simulations/physics/Sand Stones.sim`. In this simulation, we can try out pushing simple geometric objects around with the mouse cursor. We first zoom out a bit and switch from the navigation mode to the editor by clicking on the pencil icon at the bottom left (or alternatively via the _Editor_ menu and then by invoking _Activate_).
