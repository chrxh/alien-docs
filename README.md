# What is ALIEN?

**A**rtificial **LI**fe **EN**vironment (**ALIEN**) is an artificial life simulation tool based on a specialized 2D particle engine in CUDA for soft bodies and fluid-like media. Each simulated body consists of a network of smart particles that can be enriched with higher-level functions, ranging from pure information processing capabilities to physical equipment (such as sensors, actuators, weapons, constructors, etc.) whose executions are orchestrated by a signaling system. The bodies can be thought of as agents or digital organisms operating in a common environment.
